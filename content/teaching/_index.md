I believe teaching is not only about imparting knowledge to the students (what) but also about helping them develop a way of thinking and practicing (how to). I believe that teaching is not a one-way communication but a process of constructive interaction that involves both the teacher and the students. From introductory to advanced courses, my goal in teaching is not only to pass on knowledge but to inspire students to think critically, apply knowledge in real-world settings, and become responsible and engaged citizens in society.
