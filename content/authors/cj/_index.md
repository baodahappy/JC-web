I am an assistant professor in the Advertising and Public Relations major program in the school of communications at Grand Valley State University. My research primarily focuses on media effects and health communication, particularly in the context of interactive communication technologies. My work has been recognized in the form of the Top Student Paper Award and Professional Relevance Award at the Association of Educators in Journalism and Mass Communications (AEJMC). I published research papers in peer-reviewed journals such as Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, Health Communication, and Journal of Business Research. Before my academic career, I held marketing and retail management positions in multicultural organizations. As a certified translator, I published six solo translated books in marketing, communication, psychology, and philosophy.

During my master’s and doctoral studies, I have been the instructor of record for both introductory and upper-division undergraduate courses in varied teaching contexts (face-to-face, hybrid, and online) including <em>Digital Media Analytics</em>, <em>Research Methods in Advertising and Public Relations</em>, <em>Mass Media & Society</em>, and <em>Public Speaking</em>.
