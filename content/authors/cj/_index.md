I am a Ph.D. Candidate in mass communication and a University Graduate Fellow at Penn State University’s Donald P. Bellisario College of Communications. I have dual B.A. degrees in Finance and Marketing from Tianjin University of Finance & Economics, China. I worked in marketing and retail management positions after graduation. I was also a freelance translator and have published six solo translated books in social science subjects including business, psychology, and philosophy. I earned my M.A. in communication studies from Northern Illinois University where I developed my current research interests in media studies.  

My primary research program is situated at the intersection of media effects, health and strategic communication, particularly in the context of interactive communication technologies. More specifically, I am interested in exploring how (social) emotions evoked by media motivate and shape risk perceptions and health behaviors, as well as the potential of interactive media technologies like chatbots, AI algorithms, and video games for promoting health behaviors and personal well-being. 

During my master’s and doctoral studies, I have been the instructor of record for both introductory and upper-division undergraduate courses in varied teaching contexts (face-to-face, hybrid, and online) including <em>Digital Media Analytics</em>, <em>Research Methods in Advertising and Public Relations</em>, <em>Mass Media & Society</em>, and <em>Public Speaking</em>.
