The class will cover the fundamentals of traditional media audience analysis, web metrics, and social media metrics, specifically as they relate to audience measurement, advertising campaign evaluation and content distribution. Students will learn the methods of data collection, analysis and use for traditional broadcast media, and the transformation of these practices in the newly digitized and converged multiplatform, multiscreen environment. The course will also cover the basics of data capture for new media (at an appropriate technical level), and the use of this data for the design of metrics appropriate for various purposes such as monitoring traffic, conversions and revenue generation. The use of metrics in pricing models for advertising, sales generation and content distribution will also be covered. Students will be introduced to data sources for digital media audience analysis, with a special focus on Google Analytics. Students passing this class would be able to pass the Google Analytics Individual Qualification test.\nCourse objectives   Understand metrics and key performance indicators for web analytics and social media metrics; sources of data for new media, including web analytics platforms such as Google Analytics, online surveys and competitive intelligence.\n  Prepare students to take the Google Analytics Individual Qualification (GAIQ) certification exam.\n  Learn key skills such as quantification, basic statistical tests, reasoning with numbers, performance measurement and tracking, financial metrics.\n  The course is for students who intend to pursue careers in web analytics, digital analytics, social media analytics, or in new media departments of traditional content providers.\n  ","date":1654041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654041600,"objectID":"6f6965bc2d7bf16292a0164389ff7214","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/teaching/_comm310/","publishdate":"2022-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/_comm310/","section":"teaching","summary":"Summer 2022; Penn State University","tags":null,"title":"COMM310 Digital Media Metrics","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This paper explores the self-reported impact of playing video games of varied intensities on perceptions of emotion regulation and recovery during times of stress and addresses in-game demand as a prominent factor contributing to differences in gaming experiences.

Results demonstrated notable distinctions between the recollections of playing these two classes of video games on user experiences. Both types of games were perceived to lower self-reported negative emotions among the participants, with easy games tending to correlate with higher positive emotions for users post game.

We conducted a 3 (disclosure type: none vs. influencer vs. Danmaku disclosure) x 2 (ad position: beginning vs. end of the video) between-subject factorial experiment among a native Chinese sample. The results showed that Danmaku and influencer disclosure were equally effective on ad recognition but differed in attitudinal persuasion knowledge as Danmaku disclosure induced greater dislike, skepticism, and perceived inappropriateness. There was no effect of sponsorship placement on outcome variables. Furthermore, ad recognition affected brand outcomes via attitudinal persuasion knowledge.

Or will they raise unrealistic user expectations? We explored these questions with a 2 (chatbot profile: human-like vs. machine-like) x 2 (message interactivity: high vs. low) x 2 (ad type: narrative vs. factual) experiment (N = 414). Data reveal that high message interactivity fosters positive attitudes toward the chatbot and the ad by increasing perceptions of social presence, as well as by mitigating violated expectancy. When a chatbot is machine-like in appearance, higher interactivity and adoption of a narrative style of delivery serve to increase ad persuasiveness by heightening social presence.
